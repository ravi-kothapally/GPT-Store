To install Apache JMeter on Ubuntu 20.04 via the terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` or searching for "Terminal" in the applications menu.

2. Update your package lists to ensure you're working with the latest versions available:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

3. Install the default version of JMeter available in the Ubuntu repository. Note that this might not be the latest version, but it's often stable:

```bash
sudo apt install jmeter
```

4. Wait for the installation to complete. Once done, you can verify the installation by typing:

```bash
jmeter --version
```

This command should display the installed JMeter version. If you prefer to install the latest version from the official Apache website, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of JMeter from the Apache JMeter website. At the time of writing, the link to the latest binary is: [Apache JMeter Downloads](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the JMeter binary using `cd` command. For instance, if you've downloaded it to the "Downloads" directory:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

3. Unpack the downloaded archive (assuming you downloaded a .tgz file):

```bash
tar -xvzf apache-jmeter-*.tgz
```

Replace `apache-jmeter-*.tgz` with the actual filename you downloaded, as it might differ based on the version.

4. Move the extracted JMeter folder to a suitable location. For instance, you might move it to `/opt`:

```bash
sudo mv apache-jmeter-* /opt/jmeter
```

5. Set up environmental variables by editing the `.bashrc` file:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following lines at the end of the file:

```bash
export JMETER_HOME=/opt/jmeter
export PATH=$PATH:$JMETER_HOME/bin
```

Press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and finally `Enter` to save and exit the nano editor.

6. To apply the changes, either close and reopen the terminal or run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

7. Verify the installation by checking the JMeter version:

```bash
jmeter --version
```

This should display the version of the manually installed JMeter.

Now, you should have Apache JMeter installed on your Ubuntu 20.04 system.
